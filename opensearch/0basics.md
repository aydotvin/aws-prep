-	What is it?
	-	Takes input from logs, metrics, messages, config information and documents and lists. This returns output to real time insights.
-	History? license conflict and stuff
- Why is it required?
- How it does what it does? How it works?
	-	Takes large amounts of raw data and helps in providing visual charts that present meaningful information (opensearch dashboard).
	-	It makes it easier for users to explore their data. 
	-	How documents are added, how are they read, how are they updated, how are they deleted and invalidated? How to visualise the data and build interactive dashboard?
	-	Properties supported by opensearch APIs such as "analyzer", "token"
	-	Post object params
- What are the alternatives?
	-	Algolia
	-	
-	Why opensearch?
	-	Mature product with more community support.
	-	Allows us to use fuzzy search to support spelling mistakes.?
- Market coverage
-	Use cases:
	-	Monitor and debug application system performance. (using dashboards and stuff)
	-	Manage security across the network centrally.
	-	Seamless and fast personalised search.
- Big names using this
- Normal console usage and usage in the project
-	Drawbacks:
	-	The limit for the number of records and "index"s.
