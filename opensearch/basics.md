## What is it?

- It is a distributed search and analytics engine that is designed for scalability, speed, and flexibility.
- It is distributed because it distributes data and processing across a cluster of nodes, enabling it to handle large-scale data sets and achieve high performance and fault tolerance.

## Features:

- AWS Managed Service: AWS provides this service and it can handle the provisioning, patching, scaling and backups of the clustesrs of this service.
- Scalability: The service can scale the cluster up or down based on the requirements. You can add or remove nodes dynamically to adjust the cluster's capacity and performance. This flexibility allows you to handle varying workloads and accommodate growth over time.
- High Availability: AWS OpenSearch Service automatically distributes your data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region to provide high availability and fault tolerance. If a node or an entire AZ fails, OpenSearch Service automatically handles the failover and replication, ensuring that your data remains accessible.
- Cross Integration:
